# marvel-heroes
Heavily inspired by skydoves (Jaewoong Eum) implementation of clean MVVM architecture in Android with Kotlin. I use Marvel's public API. If you find any problem with my use of this API, let me know at ignacioeloyola@gmail.com and I'll remove or change stuff ASAP.

This is only an attempt to learn and practice new architecture concepts for me. However, if you find something useful, good for you! You are free to take it.

Have a great day, and thank you for stepping by ^^
